 * to define the requirements and features of the system. Here are some common
 * requirements for a school management system:
 * 
 * 1. User Management: - Authentication and authorization for administrators,
 * teachers, students, and parents. - User registration, login, and password
 * management.
 * 
 * 2. StudentEntity Management: - StudentEntity registration and enrollment. -
 * StudentEntity profile management (personal information, attendance, grades,
 * etc.). - Class and section assignment.
 * 
 * 3. TeacherEntity Management: - TeacherEntity profile management (personal
 * information, qualifications, etc.). - Assignment of subjects and classes. -
 * Attendance management.
 * 
 * 4. Course and Curriculum Management: - Course creation and management. -
 * Assignment of teachers to courses. - Curriculum planning and scheduling.
 * 
 * 5. Attendance Management: - Recording and tracking student and teacher
 * attendance. - Generating attendance reports.
 * 
 * 6. Grade book Management: - Recording and managing student grades. -
 * Calculation of overall grades. - Generating grade reports.
 *
